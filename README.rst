1. Still need to figure how to manage different urls in channels


Milestone:
1. Send messages to a group.

Unable to put ipdb or print statements in the view to debug

Issue found - turns out the name of the keyword argument was different from the name of the argumment passed.
Strange - It should have thrown an error in this case. It took long for me to figure out this issue.
